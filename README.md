# Pygame Space Invaders and Missile Dodge Games

This repository contains two simple games developed using the Pygame library: Space Invaders and Missile Dodge.

## Space Invaders

The `space_invaders.py` script implements a classic Space Invaders game. Players control a spaceship at the bottom of the screen, shooting at incoming alien enemies. The goal is to survive as long as possible while shooting down enemies and avoiding their bullets. The game includes multiple levels with increasing difficulty.

### Instructions

1. Install Python and Pygame library if not already installed.
2. Run the `space_invaders.py` script to start the game.
3. Use the arrow keys to move the player's spaceship and the spacebar to shoot.

## Missile Dodge

The `missile_dodge.py` script implements a game where players control a jet, dodging missiles and clouds while flying across the screen. The game is an endless runner where the player's goal is to achieve a high score by avoiding obstacles for as long as possible.

### Instructions

1. Install Python and Pygame library if not already installed.
2. Run the `missile_dodge.py` script to start the game.
3. Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the jet and avoid missiles and clouds.
